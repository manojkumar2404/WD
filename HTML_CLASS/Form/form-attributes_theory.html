    <h3>action</h3>
    <ul>

        <li>The default HTTP method when submitting form data is GET. </li>
        <li>GET</li>
        <ol>
            <li>NEVER use GET to send sensitive data! (the submitted form data is visible in the URL!)</li>

        </ol>
    </ul>
    <h3>enctype</h3>

        <ol>
            <li>application/x-www-form-urlencoded Default. All characters are encoded before sent (spaces are converted
                to "+" symbols, and special characters are converted to ASCII HEX values)</li>
            <li>multipart/form-data This value is necessary if the user will upload a file through the form</li>
            <li>text/plain Sends data without any encoding at all. Not recommended</li>
        </ol>

    </ul>
